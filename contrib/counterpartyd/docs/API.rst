Interacting with the API
=========================

.. warning::

    This API documentation is still in an early state. It contains errors, omissions, etc., and could change drastically at any time.
    

Overview
----------

``counterpartyd`` features a full-fledged JSON RPC 2.0-based API, which allows
third-party applications to perform functions on the Counterparty network
without having to deal with the low‚Äêlevel details of the protocol such as
transaction encoding and state management.


Connecting to the API
----------------------

By default, ``counterpartyd`` will listen on port ``4000`` (if on mainnet) or port ``14000`` (on testnet) for API
requests. API requests are made via a HTTP POST request to ``/api/``, with JSON-encoded
data passed as the POST body. For more information on JSON RPC, please see the `JSON RPC 2.0 specification <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`__.

PHP Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^

With PHP, you can connect and query ``counterpartyd`` using the `json-rpc2php <https://github.com/subutux/json-rpc2php>`__
library. Here's a simple example that will get you the asset balances for a specific address:

.. code-block:: php

    $client = new jsonRPCClient('http://localhost:4000/jsonrpc/', array('username' => 'myusername', 'password' => 'mypass'));
    $addr = '15vA2MJ4ESG3Rt1PVQ79D1LFMBBNtcSz1f'; // BTC/XCP address you want to query
    $res = $client->get_balances(array('field' => 'address', 'op' => '==', 'value' => $addr));



Terms & Conventions
---------------------

.. _assets:

assets
^^^^^^^^^

Everywhere in the API an asset is referenced as an uppercase alphabetic (base
26) string name of the asset, of at least 4 characters in length and not starting with 'A', or as 'BTC' or 'XCP' as appropriate. Examples are:

- "BTC"
- "XCP"
- "FOOBAR"

.. _quantitys:

Quantities & balances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anywhere where an quantity is specified, it is specified in **satoshis** (if a divisible asset), or as whole numbers
(if an indivisible asset). To convert satoshis to floating-point, simply cast to float and divide by 100,000,000.

Examples:

- 4381030000 = 43.8103 (if divisible asset)
- 4381030000 = 4381030000 (if indivisible asset) 

**NOTE:** XCP and BTC themselves are divisible assets, and thus are listed in satoshis.

.. _ratios:

floats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Floats are are ratios or floating point values with six decimal places of precision, used in bets, dividends and callbacks.

.. _filtering:

Filtering Read API results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Counterparty API aims to be as simple and flexible as possible. To this end, it includes a straightforward
way to filter the results of most :ref:`Read API functions <read_api>` to get the data you want, and only that.

For each Read API function that supports it, a ``filters`` parameter exists. To apply a filter to a specific data field,
specify an object (e.g. dict in Python) as this parameter, with the following members:

- field: The field to filter on. Must be a valid field in the type of object being returned
- op: The comparison operation to perform. One of: ``"=="``, ``"!="``, ``">"``, ``"<"``, ``">="``, ``"<="``
- value: The value that the field will be compared against. Must be the same data type as the field is
  (e.g. if the field is a string, the value must be a string too)

If you want to filter by multiple fields, then you can specify a list of filter objects. To this end, API functions
that take ``filters`` also take a ``filterop`` parameter, which determines how the filters are combined when multiple
filters are specified. It defaults to ``"and"``, meaning that filters are ANDed togeher (and that any match
must satisfy all of them). You can also specify ``"or"`` as an alternative setting, which would mean that
filters are ORed together, and that any match must satisfy only one of them.

To disable filtering, you can just not specify the filter argument (if using keyword-based arguments), or,
if using positional arguments, just pass ``null`` or ``[]`` (empty list) for the parameter.

For examples of filtering in-use, please see the :ref:`API code examples <examples>`.

NOTE: Note that with strings being compared, operators like ``>=`` do a lexigraphic string comparison (which
compares, letter to letter, based on the ASCII ordering for individual characters. For more information on
the specific comparison logic used, please see `this page <http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons>`__.

.. _encoding_param:

The ``encoding`` Parameter of ``create_`` Calls 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All ``create_`` API calls return an *unsigned raw transaction string*, hex encoded (i.e. the same format that ``bitcoind`` returns
with its raw transaction API calls).

The exact form and format of this unsigned raw transaction string is specified via the ``encoding`` and ``pubkey`` parameters on each ``create_``
API call:

- To return the transaction as an **OP_RETURN** transaction, specify ``opreturn`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
  Note that as of ``bitcoind`` 0.9.0, not all Counterparty transactions are possible with OP_RETURN, due to the 40
  byte limit imposed by the ``bitcoind`` client in order for the transaction to be relayed on mainnet.
- To return the transaction as a **multisig** transaction, specify ``multisig`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
    
    - If the source address is in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``. ``pubkey`` can be left as ``null``.
    - If the source address is *not* in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``, ``pubkey`` should be set to the hex-encoded
      public key.

- To return the Counterparty transaction encoded into arbitrary address outputs (i.e. pubkeyhash encoding), specify
  ``pubkeyhash`` for the ``encoding`` parameter. ``pubkey`` is also required to be set (as above, with ``multisig`` encoding)
  if the source address is not contained in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``. Note that this method is **not** recommended
  as a first-resort, as it pollutes the UTXO set.

With any of the above settings, as the *unsigned* raw transaction is returned from the ``create_`` API call itself, you
then have two approaches with respect to broadcasting the transaction on the network:

- If the private key you need to sign the raw transaction is in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``, you can simply call the
  ``transmit`` API call and pass it to the raw unsigned transaction string.
- If the private key you need to sign the raw transaction is *not* in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``, you must first sign
  the transaction yourself before calling ``transmit``. You must then pass the resultant signed
  hex-encoded transaction to ``transmit`` when you do call it, and specify ``is_signed`` as ``true``.
