Grantcoin Official Code Repository
==================================

### What is Grantcoin?
[Grantcoin](http://www.grantcoin.org/) (abbreviated GRT), which was launched on May 1, 2015, is the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) distributed primarily as charitable grants according to a transparent plan by a legally incorporated nonprofit organization. Grantcoin's technology is based on [Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/) (PPCoin), an offshoot of [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). Like Bitcoin, the Grantcoin network is currently powered by SHA-256 Proof-of-Work mining, and does not use Peercoin's Proof-of-Stake system for distributing block rewards. In 2016, the [Grantcoin Foundation](http://www.grantcoin.org/foundation/) plans to transition the currency to a new, more egalitarian system for distribution of inflation, which will be developed from the Proof-of-Stake code.
